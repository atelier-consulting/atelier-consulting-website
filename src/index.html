    <h2>You&#32;<em>know what to</em>&#32;expect<em>&#32;from</em>&nbsp;excellent service, we<em>&nbsp;know&nbsp;how&nbsp;to</em>&#32;deliver it</h2>
    <article>
      <h3>Analysis.&#32;</h3>
      <p>
        Before creating anything, we will start by&nbsp;getting to&nbsp;know you and your business,
        your hopes and dreams about it.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Strategy.&#32;</h3>
      <p>
        As soon as we have figured out where you want to go, we&nbsp;create a&nbsp;route for how to get there. We call it strategy and send to you along with price and a deadline.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Flexibility.&#32;</h3>
      <p>
        We iterate frequently, reacting fast to&nbsp;market changes or&nbsp;adapting to your customers' needs. Between iterations we analyze feedback, then prioritize and refine our strategy.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Dedication.&#32;</h3>
      <p>
        And we almost never stop. Usually we support and&nbsp;evolve our products after shipping throughout their lifetime.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Honesty.&#32;</h3>
      <p>We fix time and budget, but leave the scope flexible. You&nbsp;don't overpay, your product will be delivered in time, but&nbsp;some features will likely be postponed to next iteration.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Passion.&#32;</h3>
      <p>We truly love our trade and value our reputation. We never compromise on quality, always take responsibility for result and want to see our signature on it.</p>
