    <h1>We are those specific guys who&nbsp;make&nbsp;simple but smart products</h1>
    <p>
      We create digital goods that solve business problems: automate proces&shy;ses, gather insights
      and improve your customers’ quality of life.
    </p>
    <p class="m">
      Our team is intentionally small. Usually&nbsp;we are working on one product at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our clients are passionate profes&shy;sionals who do care, and&nbsp;we have unusually close relationship with them.

    <article>
      <h3>Love</h3>
      <p>
        Creating a product is about making people fall&nbsp;in love with it. But it doesn't start there.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Honesty</h3>
      <p>
        A good product needs to be honest, it&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;promise that can be delivered.
        But&nbsp;we don't start even there.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Analysis</h3>
      <p>
        Before we actually create anything, we start by&nbsp;getting to&nbsp;know you and your business,
        your hopes and dreams about it.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Strategy</h3>
      <p>
        As soon as we have figured out where you want to go, we create a route for how to get there.
        We call it strategy and send it to you along with price and a deadline.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Flexibility</h3>
      <p>
        We iterate frequently, reacting fast to&nbsp;market changes or adapting to your customers' needs.
        Between iterations we analyze feedback, then prioritize and refine our strategy.
      </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Dedication</h3>
      <p>
        And we don't stop. We usually support and&nbsp;evolve our products after shipping throughout their lifetime.
